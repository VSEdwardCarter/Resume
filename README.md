In this project I was tasked to explore data by using R Project. I selected data found at the EPA's CASTNET site. [https://www.epa.gov/castnet]

I analyzed the particulate matter of four different locations. Three of these locations were in California (two southern, one northern) and the last location was located in Montana at Glacier National Park.

The PDF has the actual presentation while the RMD is coded in R.
