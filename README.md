## Professional Experience

### Ennoble First (SAFFIRE) 12/2023 – Present Senior Data Engineer
* Principal Data Engineer on a cloud-native, Kubernetes-based data platform supporting Intelligence
Community GEOINT and ISR workflows across multiple operational enclaves (dev/test/prod).
* Developed and validated services and data pipelines in lower environments and deployed to higher-
classification production enclaves, ensuring consistency, auditability, and operational reliability.
* Architected and maintained high-volume batch and streaming-style data pipelines processing tens of
millions of records per day across AWS and hybrid environments.
* Designed ingestion, transformation, and indexing workflows enabling near-real-time search and exploita-
tion of geospatial and observational data.
* Operated and optimized distributed search and indexing systems (Elastic/Kibana), maintaining data
integrity and availability across environments.
* Built fault-tolerant pipelines in Scala and Python, reducing end-to-end processing time by while improv-
ing system resiliency.
* Developed mission-facing frontend features using TypeScript and Svelte, integrating with backend APIs
and data services to support analyst workflows.
* Implemented complex UI components (e.g., data grids, forms, imagery and observation tooling) to
visualize, filter, and manage large-scale intelligence datasets.
* Collaborated closely with backend, data, and platform teams to align frontend behavior with data
models, validation rules, and security constraints.
* Supported production systems in TS/SCI environments, balancing performance, security controls, and
operational risk across the full stack.
* Improved analyst workflow efficiency by reducing UI-driven data errors and improving validation and
feedback in mission forms.

### Los Alamos National Laboratory (Programming & Runtime Environment) 09/2023 – 12/2023 Data Engineer
* Created and deployed RHEL and Ubuntu servers in unclassified and DOE-classified environments with
custom services.
* Designed and deployed microservice architecture for license management supporting HPC utilization.
* Created, deployed, and monitored Kubernetes clusters hosting Docker containers to standardize delivery;
increased team productivity by ˜10%.

### Army Software Factory (Army Futures Command) 05/2021 – 12/2023 Software Engineer / Data Engineer
* Built and maintained ETL pipelines shaping and transporting 500M+ rows of data, reducing runtime
from 24 hours to ˜26 minutes.
* Developed data pipelines aggregating messaging/internal data and delivering to DoD platforms via AWS
S3.
* Tuned and restructured databases to reduce 504 errors by 84% for users in limited-connectivity environ-
ments.
* Mined and wrangled data from APIs and web sources using Spring-based services to ingest historical
and current acquisition data into relational stores.

### Texas ProTax 04/2021 – 09/2022 Data Engineer
* Aggregated disparate datasets (SQL/NoSQL) to provide curated training and analytics datasets for
AI/ML workflows.
* Conducted EDA using Pandas/NumPy/scikit-learn to characterize data and inform model selection and
tuning.

### United States Army 09/2002 – 04/2024 
Intelligence Analyst / Data Analyst → Data Scientist → Data Architect
* Applied data analysis techniques to multi-source intelligence datasets, performing data cleansing, corre-
lation, and trend analysis.
* Built statistical and predictive models to support forecasting and decision-making under uncertainty.
* Designed and maintained analytical data structures and pipelines to support repeatable analysis at scale.
* Served as a technical bridge between analysts and engineers, defining data requirements and system
architecture.



## Selected Projects
### Classification-Aware Federated Pareto Optimization
Python, PyTorch, Federated Learning
* Designed a classification-aware federated learning approach to identify Pareto-efficient tradeoffs across
performance, fairness, and resource cost.
* Implemented multi-objective optimization to support decision-making across heterogeneous clients and
constrained environments.
* Evaluated convergence and tradeoff stability versus baseline federated learning strategies.

### Large-Scale PySpark Medallion Data Pipeline
PySpark, Delta Lake, Parquet
* Architected an end-to-end bronze–silver–gold medallion pipeline for large analytical datasets using PyS-
park.
* Implemented data quality rules and investigation tables to isolate invalid records while preserving analyst
visibility.
* Optimized transformations and partitioning to support downstream analytics and ML workloads.

### Geospatial Analytics and Visualization Platform (DoD / SAFFIRE Context)
Databricks, Apache Sedona, H3, AWS
* Built a geospatial analytics pipeline backed by medallion tables to support analyst workflows at scale.
* Integrated H3 indexing and WKT geometries to enable performant spatial joins, clustering, and filtering.
* Delivered interactive map-based analysis using geospatial SQL and Kepler.gl for operational use cases.

### Kubernetes-Based Local Data Science Environment
Kubernetes, Docker, Postgres, Qdrant/pgvector
* Designed a reproducible local Kubernetes environment for data engineering and ML experimentation
2aligned to cloud-native patterns.
* Integrated relational and vector storage services to support retrieval and embedding workflows end-to-
end.
* Improved developer productivity through scripted workflows, service orchestration, and observability-
friendly configuration.
